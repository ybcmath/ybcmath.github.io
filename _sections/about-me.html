    I worked on large-scale recommendation systems and spatio-temporal data modeling from human activities such as social network via deep generative models such as multivariate self-exicting 
    point processes. This work was supported by a National Institute of Justice Graduate Research Fellowship 
    <a href="https://www.nij.gov/funding/fellowships/graduate-research-fellowship/Pages/grf-stem.aspx">(GRF-STEM)</a>. I also working on time series analysis in medical imaging
    and seismology using machine learning. Some of this work has been in conjunction with Los Alamos National Laboratory. 
     My PhD advisor is <a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/">Andrea Bertozzi</a>
