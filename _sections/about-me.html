<p>I started as a Research Scientist in Facebook after receiving my PhD from UCLA in March 2020. 
 Before that I graduated with a B.S. in Math from Zhejiang University. 
 During my Ph.D. study, I also did internships at FB, Alibaba DAMO academy and Los Alamos National Laboratory, 
 working on various areas such as graph-based product recommendation, deep generative models for spatio-temporal data modeling and 
 time series analysis in medical imaging and seismology. My PhD research was supported by a National Institute of Justice Graduate Research Fellowship 
    <a href="https://www.nij.gov/funding/fellowships/graduate-research-fellowship/Pages/grf-stem.aspx">(GRF-STEM)</a>.

<p>
    I am currently interested in large-scale recommendation systems (Ads ranking) using approaches from graph learning, representation learning and optimization.
