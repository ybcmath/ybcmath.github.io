<p>I'm a fourth-year graduate student at UCLA, working in applied math 
        with <a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/">Andrea Bertozzi</a>.</p>

<p> 
    I'm currently modeling spatio-temporal data from human activities such as 
    violent crimes and social network via multivariate self-exicting 
    point process. I also working on time series analysis in medical imaging
    and seismology using machine learning. Some of this work has been in conjunction with Los Alamos National Laboratory.
