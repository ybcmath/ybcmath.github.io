<p>I'm a final-year graduate student at UCLA, working in applied math 
        with <a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/">Andrea Bertozzi</a>. I graduated with a B.S. in Math from Zhejiang University.

    I'm currently working on large-scale spatio-temporal data modeling from human activities such as 
    violent crimes and social network via deep multivariate self-exicting 
    point process. This work was supported by a National Institute of Justice Graduate Research Fellowship 
    <a href="https://www.nij.gov/funding/fellowships/graduate-research-fellowship/Pages/grf-stem.aspx">(GRF-STEM)</a>. I also working on time series analysis in medical imaging
    and seismology using machine learning. Some of this work has been in conjunction with Los Alamos National Laboratory.
